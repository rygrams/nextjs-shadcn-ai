          This AI component is built to feel like a natural extension of the ShadCN 
          and Radix UI ecosystem—clean, consistent, and composable. Its API is intentionally 
          minimal yet expressive, offering powerful defaults while staying flexible.
          Designed with both developers and end-users in mind, it enhances the user experience 
          through intuitive interactions, thoughtful accessibility, and seamless visual 
          integration. The result is an AI interface that works effortlessly, looks native, 
          and scales beautifully.
